tomorrow\r\nBut like the tide her love has come and gone\r\nAnd it's time for me to go\r\n\r\nI saw goodbye in her eyes\r\nI don't think I can change it\r\nThere's no way to disguise\r\nWe will never make it\r\n\r\nNow she sees right through me\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use
